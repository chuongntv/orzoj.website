problem description in the database is a serialized array of (<field name> => <value>)
standard field names:
	time: time limit
	memory: memory limit
	desc: problem description
	range: data range
	source: where the problem is originally published
	hint: some hints?
these fields are parsed and converted to HTML by themes

Note:
	1. for required functions for theme, see theme-functions-template.php
	2. see also filter_list.txt
	3. all the pages accessed by user except those in install are in / and /admin
	4. themes should not operate on database directly except when quering for records (because record queries
		are usually highly customized, so no API is provided)
