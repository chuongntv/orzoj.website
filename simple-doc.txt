problem description (column desc) in the database is a serialized array of (<field name> => <value>)
standard field names:
	time: time limit 
	memory: memory limit
	desc: problem description
	input_fmt: input format
	output_fmt: output format
	input_samp: input sample
	output_samp: output sample
	range: data range
	source: where the problem is originally published
	hint: some hints?
these fields are parsed and converted to HTML by themes

Note:
	1. for required functions for theme, see theme-functions-template.php
	2. see also filter_list.txt
	3. all the pages accessed by user except those in install are in / and /admin
	4. themes should not operate on database directly except when quering for records (because record queries
		are usually highly customized, so no API is provided)
	5. One problem can only belong to one contest simultaneously
	6. all text data saved in database should be properly HTML encoded
	7. if you are running this website on nginx and can not open 
		open pages whose url seems like 'http://localhost/orzoj-website/problem/',
		please append:

			define('DISABLE_URI_REWRITE', TRUE);

		to file config.php

	judge_info_list:
		serialized array of what should be queried in /orz.php : get_query_list()

	static_password:

	dynamic_password, dynamic_password_with_time:
		generated for orzoj-server authentication (/orz.php)

	thread_req_id:
